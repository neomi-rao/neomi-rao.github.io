## Research Interests 
As the human population increases, we are altering the environment in devastating ways. From [climate change](https://flic.kr/p/W3wPeE) to pumping pollutants into the Earth's soil, waterways, and atmosphere, we are in desperate need of sweeping solutions to cleaning up our environment. I am interested in the microbial role of mediating effects of human intervention, specifically in allowing hosts to adapt to environmental changes. Scientists have observed microbes (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) making a difference in coral reef bleaching (Webster & Reusch, 2017), drought tolerance in plants(Márquez et al., 2007), and fighting [invasive species](http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/ChestnutBlightDisease.aspx). Understanding how microbes shape the boundaries of what environments their hosts can inhabit will become even more important as the conditions of Earth shift due to human influence.

In the Currie lab, we use fungus-farming ants as a model system to answer a wide range of evolutionary and ecological questions. The main components of the ant-microbe symbiosis are pictured below. The ants have an obligate mutualism with a fungal cultivar. The ants bring substrate (e.g. leaves, insect frass, decaying vegetation) to the fungus, which then breaks the substrate down for the ants to eat! Just like in human agriculture, the ants' crop (the fungal cultivar) has some natural enemies. *Escovopsis* is a fungal pathogen that inhibits the growth of the ants' fungal cultivar.  Over millions of years, the ants have developed a way to control *Escovopsis* with another symbiont, *Pseudonocardia*. *Pseudonocardia* is an [actinobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria) that grows on the bodies of the ants. *Pseudonocardia* secretes secondary metabolites (i.e. antibiotics) that kill *Escovopsis*, which can be seen by the lack of growth surrounding the colony of *Pseudonocardia* in the *Escovopsis* picture! As a result of all these complex relationships, we can study a wide variety of things, from antibiotic resistance to plant degradation for biofuels!

I am interested in the *other* associations in the fungus-farming ants. Specifically, I want to know what other microbes are contributing to the symbiosis and how this allows for fungus-farming ants to adapt to their environment. For example, we know two bacterial symbionts, *Klebsiella* and *Pantoea*, are nitrogen fixers for leaf-cutter ants (Pinto-Tomas, A. A., et al., 2009). Nitrogen is a growth-limiting resource in leaf-cutter ant agriculture, so these two bacteria supplement extra nitrogen in exchange for a place to live. Without these two bacteria, the fungus-farming ants would continue to survive; however, they would be less robust against perturbations since they are not receiving as many nutrients.

From culture-independent and culture-dependent work, we know that there is a core bacterial symbiont community in fungus gardens. I am working on characterizing these symbionts in order to contribute to our understanding of insect-microbial interactions.
