I am currently a political science PhD student specializing in American politics. Prior to the PhD, I did my MA in social sciences at the University of Chicago through the MAPSS program. I am originally from Mumbai by way of the Washington DC area, and completed a dual Bachelor's in General Biology and Linguistics at the University of Maryland College Park. I have worked in the nonprofit and survey research sectors, most recently as a survey specialist for NORC at the University of Chicago. I also do immigrant and criminal justice organizing with Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Chicago and I am involved with the local Ward 5 chapter of the Defund CPD campaign. 

## Research interests
Broadly, I am interested in the political psychology of engaging in system-challenging collective action. My MA thesis topic was on the political psychology of sustaining involvement in social movements that challenge the status quo. I continue to be interested in this research area, and the related themes of social identity, ideology, alternative futures, and sense of community. I am also interested in political psychology of solidarity across disparate social movement groups. My other areas of interest include radical imagination, movement praxis, critical theory, and the role of media and technology in social movements.

## Non-research interests!
In my free time, I enjoy trying new recipes, biking around Chicago, and watching international reality TV. When travel is possible, I love to go hiking. While mountains and hills are in short supply in the Midwest, my favorite spot for hiking and nature (realtively) near by is the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior.
