I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago Department of Political Science specializing in the study of social movements. Prior to the PhD, I did my MA in social sciences at the University of Chicago. I am originally from Mumbai by way of the Washington DC area, and completed a dual Bachelor's in General Biology and Linguistics at the University of Maryland College Park. I have worked in the nonprofit and survey research sectors, as a survey specialist for NORC at the University of Chicago and as a Communications Coordinator for the Women Empowerment Team at [CORO India](http://coroindia.org/). I am a proud member and department organizer for the UChicago graduate student labor union, [GSU-UE](https://uchicagogsu.org/). I also am an organizer with the South Asian arts collective [Chicago Mehfil](https://chicagomehfil.com/), and a fellow with [Beyond Prisons](https://csrpc.uchicago.edu/beyond_prisons/) and Prison-Neighborhood Arts + Education Project assisting with the Justice, Policy, and Culture Think Tank at Stateville Correctional Center.

## Research interests
Broadly, I am interested in the political psychology of engaging in system-challenging collective action. My MA thesis topic was on the political psychology of sustaining involvement in social justice organizing that challenges the status quo. I continue to be interested in this research area, and the related themes of social identity, ideology, alternative futures, and liberatory practices. I am also interested in solidarity and coalition-building across marginalized identities and social movement campaigns. My current work is focused on these topics in movements that seek to abolish carceral systems such as police and prisons.

## Non-research interests!
In my free time, I enjoy trying new recipes, biking around Chicago, and watching international reality TV. When travel is possible, I love to go hiking. While mountains and hills are in short supply in the Midwest, my favorite spot for hiking and nature is the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior.
